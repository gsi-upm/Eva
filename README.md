##Introduction

Indoor evacuation systems are needed for rescue and safety management. One of the challenges is to provide users with personalised evacuation routes that can follow in real time. 

To this end, this project aims at exploring the possibilities of GoogleGlass for participatory multiagent indoor evacuation simulations.  Participatory multiagent simulation combines scenario-guided agents and google-glass equipped humans that coexist in a shared virtual space and jointly perform simulations. In this project, the simulation will simulate an evacuation of the ground floor of the building B in the Telecommunication Engineering School of the Universidad Polit√©cnica de Madrid.

##Structure

The project is divided in 3 parts:
- Google Glass Application 
- Web Service
- Android application

The Google Glass application will show a map of the building and the user's location along with the route that he or she will have to follow to find the exit. It is developed using the Google's Glass Development Kit (GDK).

The web service will let us send notification cards to the Google Glass user with the aim of warning him about a recent emergency. The user will be able to launch the Google Glass App by tapping in the notification card. It is developed using the Google's Mirror API.

The android application has been developed with the aim making our service more accessible to more users that do not have the Google Glass device.
